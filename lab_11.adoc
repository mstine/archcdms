= Lab 11 - Push Microservices to Cloud Foundry

== Build and Push!

. Return to the _Fortune Teller_ application directory that you finished in link:lab_03.html[Lab 3]:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/labs/initial/fortune-teller
----

. Using Maven, build and package the application:
+
----
$ mvn package
----
+
Maven will automatically download all of _Fortune Teller_'s dependencies. This may take a few moments.

. Run `scripts/create-services.sh` to create the services that you need:
+
----
$ scripts/create_services.sh
Creating service instance config-service in org org platform-eng / space nfjs-workshop as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
Creating service instance service-registry in org platform-eng / space nfjs-workshop as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
Creating service instance circuit-breaker in org platform-eng / space nfjs-workshop as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
Creating service instance fortune-db in org org platform-eng / space nfjs-workshop as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. In your PWS Space Dashboard, click *Manage* for your Config Server instance:

. Push the microservices:
+
----
$ cf push -f manifest-apps.yml
----
+
This will push the fortunes service and the ui application.

. In a browser, access the fortunes-ui application at the route that was created for you:
+

. In your PWS Space Dashboard, click *Manage* for your Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance:
+
image:Common/images/space_dashboard_2.png[]

. Access the fortunes-ui and show that the circuit breaker is registering successful requests.
+

. Stop the fortunes application:
+
----
$ cf stop fortunes
----

. Access the fortunes-ui and see that the ``fallback fortune'' is being returned.
+

. Access the fortunes-ui and show that the circuit breaker is registering short-circuited requests.
+

. Start the fortunes application:
+
----
$ cf start fortunes
----

. Continue to access the fortunes-ui and watch the dashboard.
After the fortunes service has re-registered with Eureka and the fortunes-ui load balancer caches are refreshed, you will see the circuit breaker recover.
You should then start getting random fortunes again!
