= Lab 6 - Publishing a Contract to Pact Broker

In this lab we'll publish the ``pact'' we generated in link:lab_04.html[Lab 4] to a running instance of Pact Broker on Pivotal Web Services.

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Set the API target for the CLI:
+
----
$ cf api api.run.pivotal.io
----

. Login to Pivotal Web Services:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts.

== Push Pact Broker

. Change to the Pact Broker example directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/labs/pact_broker
----

. Push Pact Broker to PWS:
+
----
$ cf push pact-broker --random-route
----

. Visit Pact Broker at the random route assigned by Cloud Foundry (e.g. http://pact-broker-distortive-broadside.cfapps.io).
+
You should see output similar to the following:

== Publish the Pact

. Change to the following directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/labs/initial/fortune-teller/fortune-teller-ui/target/pacts
----

. Publish the pact using cURL (again, use the random route provided to you by Cloud Foundry):
+
----
$ curl -i -X PUT http://pact-broker-distortive-broadside.cfapps.io/pacts/provider/FortuneService/consumer/FortuneUi/version/1.0.0 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d@FortuneUi-FortuneService.json
----
